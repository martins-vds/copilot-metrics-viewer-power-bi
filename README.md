# GitHub Copilot Metrics Viewer for Power BI

With the release of the latest [GitHub Copilot Metrics API](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/141071) many teams are looking to leverage this data to help monitor usage against their KPIs. For some, the Copilot Metrics Viewer ([github-copilot-resources/copilot-metrics-viewer](https://github.com/github-copilot-resources/copilot-metrics-viewer)) might be a great option. 

However, many organizations that we work with already have established Power BI teams. If your organization is **already using Power BI, please read on!**

## Metrics Dashboard Setup

### Connect to Metrics API
> Notes: The REST API provides metrics for the previous 28 days and is refreshed daily with data from the previous day. Please ensure you are using the latest version of the [REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics).

In order to connect we'll need to generate a token and link to your metrics data:
1. Download and open the sample `GitHub Copilot - Telemetry Sample (Metrics with KPI).pbix` file.
2. Determine if you'll be using the `Enterprise`, `Organization` or `Team` URL.
3. Follow the instructions below to generate a token with permissions to access the API:
   [REST API endpoints for Copilot metrics - GitHub Enterprise Cloud Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics)
>**IMPORTANT: Do not share this token and ensure you follow you organizations security policies.**
4. Ensure Copilot Metrics API access is enabled for your [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization) or [enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise#configuring-policies-for-github-copilot).

## Collect Feedback on GitHub Copilot Usage

To better understand how GitHub Copilot is being used in your organization and to help determine accurate time and cost savings, we recommend collecting direct feedback from your developers. This information can be used to refine the values in the KPI dashboard and ensure your savings estimates reflect real-world usage.

You can use the following **Microsoft Forms** template to gather feedback. Simply duplicate the form and customize it for your organization:

[GitHub Copilot Usage Feedback – Microsoft Forms Template](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR6zql0pB1xhIi5wwWWSq6RVUQ0JQSkZOMElYOFdHWUFWWVhPRllTQ1ZRUi4u&sharetoken=Gb49retb5qghvCQiQILO)

Gathering this feedback will help you:
- Validate or adjust the average weekly hour savings.
- Understand adoption and satisfaction.
- Support your ROI calculations with real user data.

Feel free to adapt the form to include any additional questions relevant to your team.

## KPI - Savings Dashboard
A new KPI tab has been added to the dashboard to help you estimate savings. The KPI tab is configured to display the potential time and cost savings. You can configure the KPI tab to display these details by modifying the following fields in the `config` data source from the **Table view**:

| Name                       | Description                                      |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| total_devs                 | Total number of developers at your organization. |
| avg_hourly_salary          | Average hourly salary of developers.             |
| annual_work_weeks          | Total number of work weeks in a year.            |
| average_weekly_hour_savings| Average number of hours developers saved per week. The default is 3.5 hours and assumed a 10% time saving, but this can be updated based on customer survey data or other measurements.          |

These values can be modified in the `config` data source below:

Once configured, the KPI dashboard will display this potential savings against current usage pulled from the Metrics API:
